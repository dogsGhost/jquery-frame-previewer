frame previewer
===============

Custom js functionality for a client project. Written as a jQuery plugin for ease of use.

Takes a list of image thumbnails, and when a user clicks on an thumbnail, the page scrolls to a point where a larger version on the image is revealed. Options are also revealed that allow the user to select different types of frames that are overlaid on the image. There are also a set of color options to set a different background color behind the image, to simulate wall color.

Dependencies: jQuery.
